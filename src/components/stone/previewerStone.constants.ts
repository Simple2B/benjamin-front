  `Jews traditionally mark a visit to a grave with the laying of a small stone on the grave or headstone.  
  By visiting an ancestor or person of importance in our lives, we try to make their memory last. Flowers 
  are a good metaphor for the brevity of life, but stones seem better suited to the permanence of memory. 
  Stones do not die, and Jews have a famously long memory.`,
  `An intriguing explanation for the laying of stones refers to the inscription on many Jewish gravestones. 
  The Hebrew abbreviation taf, nun, tsadi, bet, hey stands for “teheye nishmato tsrurah b’tsror ha- chayyim,” 
  a phrase usually translated  as “May his soul be bound up in the bonds of eternal life.”`,
  `Tsror also mean a stone, in Hebrew.  The placing of a stone might be an affirmation of the wishes that the 
  departed be enveloped in the bonds of eternal life.`,
  `If you are visiting the grave, please take a photo of the headstone with the stone you placed upon it and 
  upload it. `,
